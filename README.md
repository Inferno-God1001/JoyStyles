Hello, everyone! Chandom here. I’m here to talk about this repository and its purpose!

Most of the files are in CSS, and I use the browser’s inspect tool to grab the classes or IDs from the joyland.ai website so I can fully customize my bot’s page.

If you came here looking to create your own dynamic themes, unfortunately, I can’t provide full-on support, but I can share the classes for each element to try and help you out!

If you don’t know HTML or CSS yet, don’t worry! Both are VERY easy to learn, and thanks to technology, we have online lessons teaching them in many different languages around the world. ❤️
